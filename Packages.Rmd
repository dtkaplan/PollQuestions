**Do you use R packages in your teaching?**  
*Choose all that apply.*


a. No, just "base R".  
#. What are packages?
#. Only peripherally or occasionally.
#. Central to teaching at least one course.
#. I get non-CRAN packages.
#. I write packages
#. Just Hadley Wickham's packages (`ggplot2`,`dplyr`,etc.)
#. RStudio UI packages (`manipulate`, `shiny`)
#. Document support packages (e.g. `knitr`, `rmarkdown`)
